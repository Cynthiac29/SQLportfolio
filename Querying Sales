#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

SELECT * from BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20

--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales febsales
ON customers.order_id=febsales.orderID;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? For this one, you are going to use the commands distinct and MIN(). Using 'SELECT distinct' will remove duplicate rows from your results. The MIN() command will allow you to select the smallest value from the price column. This is a hard one - see if you can do it, but don't be afraid to look at the hint or answer if you need to!
SELECT distinct Product, price

GROUP BY product

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers
SELECT count(acctnum), avg(quantity*price) as spent
